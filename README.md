2.	All the above said three movies have same story; story is ……

Lead character fall in love, unfortunately his or her lover will die. Forcefully their parents will get the lead character married but the lead character will not be interested in the marriage happened but their spouse will be interested in them and will shower loads of love on the lead character. After many twist and turns in climax the lead character will start to love their spouse and they will live happily ever after.

In “Mouna Ragam” movie lead character is actress Revathi(Divya) her love interest is actor Karthick after the death of her lover she will be forcefully married to actor Mohan(Chandrakumar). After lot of interesting happenings lead character Revathi and Mohan will unite at the climax.  

In “Mella Thirandhadhu Kadhavu” movie lead character is actor Mohan(Subramani) his love interest is actress Amala(Noorjahan) after the death of Noorjahan, actor mohan will be forced to marry her cousin Tulasi after few incidents mohan will change his mind and both will get marry.

For all the three movies even the script is almost same except the plot, “Mouna Ragam” happens in metro cities Chennai and Delhi, “Mella Thirandhadhu Kadhavu’s” plot is in village and a hill station and “Enga Ooru Pattukaran” is completely in a village background. 

To your surprise music director for all the three movies is our maestro Ilayaraja.  
As mentioned in the beginning story, screenplay is same but Tamil audience made the entire three movies a blockbuster and all these are musically hit too. 

Generally staling stories and script is happening in <a href="http://www.cinemapettai.com/category/news">Tamil Movie News</a> for very long time but here who copied from whom that is a big question and only the directors can answer to this or it may be a coincidence too. Whatever said and done all the three are enjoyable movies.
